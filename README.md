onefile-auto-tetris
===================
An auto playing Tetris clone with no controls, all in a single HTML file. Features AI strategies that auto swap between them and learn wich one is more effective, to try and make the most possible lines, a playing zone as big as the viewport and a game over screen with statistics.

TODO:
- Make the AI strategies finally work and make a single line.
- Teach the AI to "soft land" a piece as a single lateral movement, after rotating the piece or not, to fill a gap.
